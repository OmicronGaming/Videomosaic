# Videomosaic
Based on a project for a university course in Mathematical Imaging, this project seeks to implement a photomosaic constructing algorithm with a client-side webapp that converts a video stream into a stream of photomosaic frames. A "photomosaic" is an image comprised of smaller "image tiles" that, when viewed altogether, resembles a new picture.
