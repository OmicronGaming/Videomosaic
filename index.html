        <h2>What is a photomosaic?</h2>
        <p>A "photomosaic" is a large, detailed picture that is made up of many, smaller photographs. 
            From afar, the picture appears as a blurry rendition of some image, but as we zoom in, we can 
            see the individual photos that act as "tiles" which comprise the bigger picture.
        </p>

        alt="Photomosaic of the Mona Lisa" width="500">
        <p>
            This project aims to implement this idea, where the "tiles" are created from famous paintings,
            and the "bigger picture" is - you! More specifically your webcam, or whatever camera is attached
            to the device you are using. (If you don't have a camera, then uhh, yeah it should be obvious
            why this isn't working lol)
        </p>
        <p>
            We can take this one step further. After all, a video is just a sequence of frames being played in 
            rapid succession, and each individual frame is just an image! This project will convert a video stream
            into a "photomosaic" stream - a "videomosaic"! (The FPS, frames-per-second, is highly dependent on
            browser capability, with a cap at 10 FPS)
